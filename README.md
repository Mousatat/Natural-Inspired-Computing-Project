This repository is based on the paper Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm for a class of combinatorial
optimization by Kuk-Hyun Han and Jong-Hwan Kim.
Experiments are conducted on the well-known combinatorial optimization issue known as the "knapsack problem" to show its efficacy and application. In comparison to the traditional genetic algorithm, the results demonstrate that QEA performs effectively even with a small population without experiencing premature convergence.
